Introduction
============

Current Doctor scenario covers the inspector and notifier in the whole fault
management cycle::

  start                                          end
    +       +         +        +       +          +
    |       |         |        |       |          |
    |monitor|inspector|notifier|manager|controller|

The performance of Doctor scenario can be profiled in a time line[#f1]::

  start                                         end

And a table[#f2] of components sorted by time cost from most to least

+----------+---------+----------+
|Component |Time Cost|Percentage|
+==========+=========+==========+
|inspector |160ms    | 40%      |
+----------+---------+----------+
|aodh      |110ms    | 30%      |
+----------+---------+----------+
|monitor   |50ms     | 14%      |
+----------+---------+----------+
|...       |         |          |
+----------+---------+----------+
|...       |         |          |
+----------+---------+----------+

A performance profiler will be implemented to measure the time cost in each
stage and report it to QTIP for visualization and analysis such as comparison
between different installers, history data.

Working Items
=============

1. Collect timestamp at each checkpoint
2. Display the performance profile in console
3. Report the performance profile to QTIP
