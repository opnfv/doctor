Design Documents
****************

This is the directory to store design documents which may include draft
versions of blueprints written before proposing to upstream OSS communities
such as OpenStack, in order to keep the original blueprint as reviewed in
OPNFV. That means there could be out-dated blueprints as result of further
refinements in the upstream OSS community. Please refer to the link in each
document to find the latest version of the blueprint and status of development
in the relevant OSS community.
