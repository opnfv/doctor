=======================================

..
    This section will be compiled into OPNFV composite document.

https://wiki.opnfv.org/doctor

Features
--------

Doctor platform, as of Brahmaputra release, provides the two features:

* Immediate Notification
* Consistent resource state awareness (Compute/host-down)

These features enable high availability of Network Services on top of
the virtualized infrastructure. Immediate notification allows VNF managers
(VNFM) to process recovery actions promptly once a failure has occurred.
Consistency of resource state is necessary to properly execute recovery
actions properly in the VIM.

Components
----------

Doctor platform, as of Brahmaputra release, consists of the following
components:

* OpenStack Compute (Nova)
* OpenStack Telemetry (Ceilometer)
* OpenStack Alarming (Aodh)
* Doctor Inspector
* Doctor Monitor

.. note::
    Doctor Inspector and Monitor are sample implementation for reference.
