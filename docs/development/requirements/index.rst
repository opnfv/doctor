:Abstract: Doctor is an OPNFV requirement project [DOCT]_. Its scope is NFVI
           fault management, and maintenance and it aims at developing and
           realizing the consequent implementation for the OPNFV reference
           platform.

           This deliverable is introducing the use cases and operational
           scenarios for Fault Management considered in the Doctor project.
           From the general features, a high level architecture describing
           logical building blocks and interfaces is derived. Finally,
           a detailed implementation is introduced, based on available open
           source components, and a related gap analysis is done as part of
           this project. The implementation plan finally discusses an initial
           realization for a NFVI fault management and maintenance solution in
           open source software.
