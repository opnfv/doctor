Inspector Design Guideline
==========================

.. NOTE::
   This is spec draft of design guideline for inspector component.
   JIRA ticket to track the update and collect comments: `DOCTOR-73`_.

This document summarize the best practise in designing a high performance
inspector to meet the requirements in `OPNFV Doctor project`_.

Problem Description
===================

Some pitfalls has be detected during the development of sample inspector, e.g.
we suffered a significant `performance degrading in listing VMs in a host`_.

A `patch set for caching the list`_ has been committed to solve issue. When a
new inspector is integrated, it would be nice to have an evaluation of existing
design and give recommendations for improvements.

This document can be treated as a source of related blueprints in inspector
projects.

Guidelines
==========

Host specific VMs list
