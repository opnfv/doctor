Doctor capabilities and usage
=============================

..
    This section will be compiled into OPNFV composite document.

Immediate Notification
----------------------

Immediate notification can be used by creating 'event' type alarm via
OpenStack Alarming (Aodh) API with relevant internal components support.

See, upstream spec document:
http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/ceilometer-specs/specs/liberty/event-alarm-evaluator.html

You can find an example of consumer of this notification in doctor repository.
It can be executed as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/doctor -b stable/brahmaputra
    cd doctor/tests
    CONSUMER_PORT=12346
    python consumer.py "$CONSUMER_PORT" > consumer.log 2>&1 &

Consistent resource state awareness (Compute/host-down)
-------------------------------------------------------

Resource state of compute host can be fixed according to an input from a monitor
sitting out side of OpenStack Compute (Nova) by using force-down API.

See
http://artifacts.opnfv.org/doctor/brahmaputra/docs/manuals/mark-host-down_manual.html
for more detail.
