      "message": "I still have a few questions. \n1. type - did we decide on whether it will be an enum or not? (I think that an enum is very limiting)\n2. monitor_id - Ryota, you previously gave an example that monitor_id\u003dhost123 and monitor_event_id\u003d111. So what is the difference between monitor_id and hostname? in any case, I would change the example to monitor_id\u003dhost123, to make it more clear \n3. what is expected in the \u0027cause\u0027 field? a description? or maybe monitor_event_id of another event?",
