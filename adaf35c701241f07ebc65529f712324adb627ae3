      "message": "I still have a few questions. \n1. type - did we decide on whether it will be an enum or not? (I think that an enum is very limiting)\n2. monitor_id - Ryota, you previously gave an example that monitor_id\u003dhost123 and monitor_event_id\u003d111. So what is the difference between monitor_id and hostname? in any case, I would change the example to monitor_id\u003dhost123, to make it more clear \n3. what is expected in the \u0027cause\u0027 field? a description? or maybe monitor_event_id of another event?",

      "message": "1. type - I prefer a single type for each event rather than enumerated list. I cannot see the benefits of enum. We can use \u0027events\u0027 and writing relation to others in \u0027details\u0027 field. And, single type of event can simplify implementation of inspector by handling an event with specific driver which can be found by the type. Correct me if I\u0027m wrong. \n\n2. monitor_id - this could be different from host. I can imagine we can have multiple monitors even in a host for vswitch, for hypervisor, and so on. Sometimes monitor can be run on multiple hosts but recognized as one virtual service, like zabbix.\n\n3. cause - yes, that would be description of the cause of this fault event which could be different from the type of this event. Yes, you can set monitor_event_id or event_id (in inspector) of another event.",
