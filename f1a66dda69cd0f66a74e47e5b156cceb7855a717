As there was some problem to have those modifications to take effect in restart, \u0027nova\u0027 matches now to both of those to ensure config file is changed for sure before restart. So delay to restart services, if we have modified nova.conf. If there would be time to make this better, surely could.",

I was first trying to change this for the better, to change the conf in container and with SIGHUP to re-read it in a fly. This anyhow did not work and it had drawback that nova.conf is copied over from the underlying host when restarting container. So this is still done as earlier.",
