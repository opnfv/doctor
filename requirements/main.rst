:Abstract: Doctor is an OPNFV requirement project [1]_. Its scope is NFVI fault
           management, and maintenance and it aims at developing and realizing
           the consequent implementation for the OPNFV reference platform.

           This deliverable is introducing the use cases and operational
           scenarios for Fault Management considered in the Doctor project. From
           the general features, a high level architecture describing logical
           building blocks and interfaces is derived. Finally, a detailed
           implementation is introduced, based on available open source
           components, and a related gap analysis is done as part of this
           project. The implementation plan finally discusses an initial
           realization for a NFVI fault management and maintenance solution in
           open source software.
