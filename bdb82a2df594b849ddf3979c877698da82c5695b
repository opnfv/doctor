This should be enough and indeed well explaining: \"if nova-compute is disabled\". To go still what I tried to put there somehow was that something like DISABLED as host_status might give impression like \"really down\", so why servers can still be running. Perhaps MAINTENANCE was chosen in the reviews not to have that impression. Anyhow all this is irrelevant here.",
