      "message": "Yes, host should not be input argument. Anyhow it doesn\u0027t make it better wither the list is good or not. Only way of caching on some level of trust, is to listen \"instance.update\" and keep the list up-to-date with that. Anyhow for sample inspector this might be avoided by our test case structure, where instances are made before inspector is initialized. So the list made in initialization would work for now, but later on if sample inspector will still be used, it needs improvements as test cases evolve with a need to update instance list during runtime of inspector.",
