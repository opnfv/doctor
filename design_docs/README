This is directory to store design documents which may includes draft version
of blueprints written before proposing upstream OSS communities such as
OpenStack, in order to keep the original blueprint as reviewed in OPNFV.
That means there could be out-of-dated blueprints as result of further
refinements in the upstream OSS coummunity. So please refer the link in each
document to find current version of blueprint and status of development in the
relevant OSS community.
